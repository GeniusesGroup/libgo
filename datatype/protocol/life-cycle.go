	// LifeCycle_PerpetualBeta where new features are continually added to the software without establishing a final "stable" release.
	// This technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues.

	// LifeCycle_ClosedBeta is released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation.
	LifeCycle_ClosedBeta
	// LifeCycle_ReleaseCandidate also known as "going silver", is a beta version with potential to be a stable product,
	// which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge
	LifeCycle_ReleaseCandidate
	// LifeCycle_StableRelease Also called production release,
	// the stable release is the last release candidate (RC) which has passed all verifications / tests.
