// Hash is the common interface implemented by all hash functions.
//
// Hash implementations in the standard library (e.g. hash/crc32 and
// crypto/sha256) implement the encoding.BinaryMarshaler and
// encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler interfaces. Marshaling a hash implementation
// allows its internal state to be saved and used for additional processing
// later, without having to re-write the data previously written to the hash.
// The hash state may contain portions of the input in its original form,
// which users are expected to handle for any possible security implications.

// Some other languages:
