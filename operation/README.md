# Operation
we categorize service, command, and query as items in the operation category.

Here's a breakdown of why:
- Service: A service is a function or action provided by a system or organization. It often involves a series of steps or processes.
- Command: A command is an instruction or order given to a system or device to perform a specific action.
- Query: A query is a request for information or data from a system.

All of these terms imply a specific action or request being performed, which aligns with the concept of an operation. Therefore, they can be effectively categorized under the operation category.
